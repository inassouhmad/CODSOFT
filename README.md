# Data Science Projects:
Dive into the world of my Data Science Projects Repository! This collection features a variety of data science projects that illustrate my dedication to the field. Each project unfolds a different story through data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.
## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction:
- Folder: `Titanic Survival Prediction`
- Description: Our goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the demographic factors influencing survival rates. Specifically, we employ machine learning tools to forecast the likelihood of passengers surviving the tragic incident.

## 2. MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON:
- Folder: `MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON`
- Description: The main objective of this project is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a film by users or critics using Linear Regression.

## 3. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:
- Folder: `IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION`
- Description: The main objective of this project is to analyze Iris flower data and develop a machine learning model(KNN) using the Iris flower dataset with three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## 4. SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON:
- Folder: `SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON`
- Description: The main objective of this project is to analyze SALES PREDICTION data and create a model (ANN) that can estimate the overall amount that consumers would spend given the following characteristics: customer name, customer email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

## 5. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
- Folder: `CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION`
- Description: Develop a machine learning model focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
Utilize the random forests classification algorithm to train the model and assess its performance through metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
